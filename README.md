# STA/LTA event detection and selection based on ObsPy

We use the **ObsPy** library that has been packaged in python for STA/LTA seismic event detection and selection. The specific parameters are in `sta_lta_event.py`.   
Install obspy by Anaconda (latest version):  
```
conda install obspy
```
or  
```
pip install obspy
```
If you would like to install a previous version, please add the corresponding version number, such as  
```
pip install obspy==1.3.0
```
