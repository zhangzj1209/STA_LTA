# STA/LTA event detection and selection based on ObsPy


![image](./fig/sta_lta.png)  


We use the **ObsPy** library that has been packaged in python for STA/LTA seismic event detection and selection. The specific parameters are in `./src/demo_sta_lta_event.py`.   

Install `obspy` by Anaconda (latest version):  
```
conda install obspy
```
or  
```
pip install obspy
```
If you would like to install a previous version (the latest version is adapted to our code), please add the corresponding version number, such as  
```
pip install obspy==1.3.0
```
